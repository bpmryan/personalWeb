  * Guessing number game
    * if wrong, send alerts again
    * if correct rickroll

* Place for the user to contact me
  *  link GitHub, LinkedIn, and email

* Mess around with animations with the cursor and loading
  * have some animations going on in the background of the window 

* Style 
  * [fonts](https://www.figma.com/resource-library/best-fonts-for-websites/): 
    * bubble sans, sans-serif
  * cursor animation
  * loading screen
  * **Background theme:**
    * Morse code of name initials 
      * transitions from morse to text 
    * Music notes that also use morse for music page
    * [Manga Background Scenery](https://www.behance.net/gallery/239584089/MANGA-BACKGROUND-ILLUSTRATION?tracking_source=search_projects|manga+panel&l=0&bid=119357)

* Very random ideas: 
  * Place to write ascii art 
    * user uploads image 
    * python function that generates it into ascii art or find a js function that also does that too
    * Question: Is there a way to call python functions in deployed GitHhub web app?
  * Guess the password game
  * Snake apple eater game
  * Random filter that changes the background of site into something randome 
    * Ideas: anime, binary, explosions, pixil, falling music notes
